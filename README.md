# The Left-Handed Ploopy Trackball

By some stroke of luck, you've made your way here. The Ploopy Trackball. For left-handed people. Your life will never be the same.

This repository contains all of the design and production files necessary to make a Ploopy Trackball. For left-handed people. We've also included some kick-ass documentation in the Wiki on how to get it made, assemble it, and program it. (It's the same as our documentation for our right-handed trackball. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ploopyco/mouse/wiki).)

What are you waiting for? Your new life awaits.

Did I mention that this is for left-handed people? Because HELL YEAH, it is.

## Schematics

Note that the schematics are the same as the right-handed version of this mouse, so the revision number will say RX.XXX, not LX.XXX. This is intentional: the mice are schematically identical, and only the layout of the PCBs is different.

## Under what license is this released?

The firmware is released under GPLv3. The hardware is released under OHL CERN v1.2. Check the respective directories for full license text.
